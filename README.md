JS Challenge: Functional programming techniques in JS
=====================================================

## Guide

This exercise is prepared to be solved in 1 hour (maybe a little bit more :-)). It is an ad-hoc repository for a short 
talk. You can use it as follows:

- Explanation: Use some well known techniques to create FP tools in JS and explain why they're useful.
- Before each exercise you can explain the technique and expose the problem.
- People have 10 minutes to take a look to each exercise and try to solve it.
- After this time slot, you can ask about feelings: do you think it's easy?, difficult? Why. Do you understand the problem?
- Take a look into solution (use debugger is a good idea to follow the steps into solution).
- Next exercise.

## Exercises

1. [Higher order functions](./src/1-higher-order-fn): Functions that handle functions.
2. [Composition](./src/2-compose): Construct composed functions by using smaller ones.
3. [Currying](./src/3-currying): Transform a function with a tuple as argument in a sequence of functions with just one param.
4. [Memoize](./src/4-memoize): Optimize pure functions performance by caching responses inside the function.
